# Hello World of Machine Learning
# Iris Data Machine Learning Project

# The main purpose of this Project is to get the kid accustomed with the steps of machine learning project discussed in the previous lesson
# The child must be able to relate the sequence of steps in order, understand the need of them

# Import the Required Libraries at the top, No need to explain the DecisionTree Thing, Would be discussed in detail during the ML stuff
